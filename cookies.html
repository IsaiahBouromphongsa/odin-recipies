    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>A Christmas cookie recipe for soft sugar cutouts that I have used for years. I sprinkle the cookies with colored sugar before baking; you can also frost them with icing when cool.</p>    
</body>

<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
    <li>3.75 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1½ cups white sugar</li>
    <li>1 cup margarine, softened</li>
    <li>2 eggs</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
</ul>

<h4>Directions</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Sift together flour, baking powder, and salt in a medium bowl; set aside.</li>
    <li>Beat sugar and margarine in a large bowl until light and fluffy. Beat in eggs one at a time, then stir in vanilla. Gradually blend in dry ingredients until incorporated. Wrap dough; chill in the refrigerator for 2 hours.</li>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease two cookie sheets.</li>
    <li>Roll out dough on a clean floured surface to 1/4-inch thickness. Cut out shapes using cookie cutters; arrange them on the prepared cookie sheets. Gather scraps and repeat this step.</li>
    <li>Bake in batches in the preheated oven until edges are barely brown, 6 to 8 minutes. Carefully transfer cookies to a wire rack to cool.</li>
</ol>
